Possible APIs to use:

- UFC: http://ufc-data-api.ufc.com/api/v1/us
- Football: http://api.football-data.org/index
- Triathalon: https://developers.triathlon.org/docs

### MVP

 - Display upcoming events on a map
 - Display results and ranking of players/teams
 - Allow users to add events to a favourites list
